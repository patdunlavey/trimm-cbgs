### The Artist
Wayne Trimm comes to wildlife painting through a background of science. Wayne grew up in an art oriented family: his father, Lee S. Trimm was a well known portrait painter in Syracuse, New York; his brother Lee was a portrait and mural painter; and his sister, Rietta, was a costume and stage designer. From his earliest recollections, Wayne was interested in nature and wildlife, so it was not surprising that he majored in the biological sciences where he picked up degrees in biology, wildlife management and forestry, and taught in these subjects at Kansas State University.

Wayne moved to New York 1953, where he was active in conservation education, writing, editing, and riding herd on pictures and layout for the award-winning New York State _Conservationist_ magazine. He also edited the _Outdoor Communicator_, the magazine for the New York State Outdoor Education Association, and _The Catuses_, a wildlife art magazine published by the Society of Animal Artists.

Wayne wrote and spoke extensively on ecology and wildlife art, designed and prepared several dioramas, painted several murals, and has illustrated many books and magazines, including for _Time-Life_, _Readers Digest_, _Audubon Society_, _National Wildlife Federation_, the _Smithsonian Institute_, _Johns Hopkins Press_, _Outdoor Life_, _Communication Arts_, _New York Times_, _Winchester Press_, _Doubleday and Company_, and _MacMillan Publishing Co._ In addition, he is listed in the _Who's Who in American Art_.

He traveled to many parts of the world to sketch, paint and photograph wildlife. He helped found the _Pope and Young_ bowhunting trophy club, the _International Bowhunter Education Foundation_, the _South Dakota Ornithological Union_, and many local bird and nature clubs. He was active with youth groups and schools, and was a guest speaker at the _American Museum of Natural History_.

Wayne organized major wildlife art shows in New York State, in addition to having his own work exhibited in many shows throughout the country. His art teaching includes the _Adirondack Art Center_, _SUNY at Albany_, _College of St. Rose_ in Albany, _Asa Wright Nature Center_ in Trinidad, the _Sagamore Institute_ at Raquette Lake, N.Y. and many other seminars and workshops. His writings and illustrations enhance many art books.

Most of all, Wayne knowledge of nature came from first-hand experience. Part of his graduate work was on animal behavior, directing his keen observation to in-depth interpretation which shows in his art work. In Wayne Trimm, the world of science and art find a common and productive meeting ground.
